# SwitchingKinetics

# System Requirements

The cumulant2timelag script was coded in MATLAB (http://www.mathworks.com). The package has been tested on windows 10 Pro systems. Minimal requirements are as following:

- Windows
- MATLAB2015b+

# Run the demo

1). Set the SwitchingKinetics script folder as current folder in MATLAB.

2). Open and run the script 'index.m'.

3). Using the default parameter settings, click the “submit-file” button and select the test data.

4). Click the “process” button to calculate the switching kinetics of bacteria clones.

5). Expected output would be an excel file with two data sheets: sheet 1 contains the raw data of the fluorescence intensities of each clone acquired under different time points; sheet 2 contains the odd frame to even frame intensity ratio of each clone.

6). Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer is about 2 minutes.

# Run SwitchingKinetics with custom data

1). Set the SwitchingKinetics script folder as current folder in MATLAB. 

2). Run script “index.m”.

3). Select an image stack with “.tiff” suffix to calculate the switching kinetics of bacteria clones using the default parameter settings.
